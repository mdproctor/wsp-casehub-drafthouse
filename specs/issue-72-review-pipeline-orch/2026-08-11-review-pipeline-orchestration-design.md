# Review Pipeline Orchestration — Design Spec

**Issue:** casehubio/drafthouse#72
**Date:** 2026-08-11
**Status:** Design approved

## Problem

Dimensional reviews (coherence, structure, robustness + cross-cutting) run as
independent processes with progress visible only in the terminal. The human has
no visual dashboard showing which dimensions are active, what findings have
accumulated, when a HIL checkpoint is pending in the terminal, or what decisions
were validated during brainstorming.

The #108 spec (phased HIL for dimensional reviews) established a three-phase
pipeline with watchdog-driven HIL checkpoints, all orchestrated from the calling
terminal session. This issue builds the browser-side visualization for that
pipeline — observation only, not control.

## Solution

A new `review-pipeline` panel in DraftHouse that provides real-time visualization
of the review pipeline. Four deliverables:

1. **Pipeline progress** — phase indicator + per-dimension cards with status,
   rounds, cost, elapsed time
2. **Findings per stage** — accumulated findings feed, grouped by dimension,
   filterable by priority
3. **HIL checkpoint indicators** — read-only status showing when a checkpoint
   is pending in the terminal
4. **Decision validation** — collapsible section showing brainstorming decisions
   with their validation status

**Interaction model:** The browser is a dashboard. HIL decisions (approve, refuse,
discuss) stay in the terminal session as #108 designed. The pipeline panel shows
state, not controls. Issue #72's description mentions browser-based HIL gates —
this was scoped to read-only checkpoint indicators during brainstorming; full
browser HIL control is a future concern.

## Server-Side Changes

### ProgressLogParser extensions

Four new event types to match review.py's existing JSONL events:

```java
public record DimensionStart(String dimension, String degree, int phase) implements ProgressEvent {}
public record RoundFindings(String dimension, int roundNumber, int issueCount,
                            Map<String, Integer> byPriority) implements ProgressEvent {}
public record RoundEnd(String dimension, int roundNumber, double cost) implements ProgressEvent {}
public record DimensionDone(String dimension, int totalRounds, double cost, int issues) implements ProgressEvent {}
```

These parse `EVENT: {...}` lines from progress.log. The `parse()` method gets
an early check for lines containing `EVENT:` — when detected, it extracts the
JSON payload and delegates to a `parseJsonEvent()` method that reads the `type`
field and constructs the appropriate record. Existing regex patterns for
plain-text lines are unchanged.

**Sealed interface impact:** Adding these records to the sealed `ProgressEvent`
interface requires updating the exhaustive switch in
`WorkspaceWatcher.toPayload()`. The new cases map to `workspace-progress`
metadata events with the same field names. This is a mechanical update.

### Module split: data model vs state machine

The review surfaced a module boundary violation: `PipelineSession` cannot live
in `server/api/` if its state-machine logic references `ProgressEvent` from
`server/runtime/`.

**Resolution:** Split concerns across modules:

- **`server/api/`** — pure data model only: `PipelineSession` (data holder),
  `DimensionDescriptor`, `PipelinePhase`, `CheckpointStatus`, `DimensionStatus`,
  `PipelineDecision`, `PipelineFinding`, `PipelineDecisionParser`. No references
  to `ProgressEvent` or any runtime class. `PipelineSession` exposes mutator
  methods (`advanceDimension(name, status)`, `setPhase(phase)`,
  `setCheckpoint(status)`) but does NOT decide when to call them.

- **`server/runtime/`** — orchestration logic: `PipelineOrchestrator`
  (`@ApplicationScoped`) owns the state machine. It receives `ProgressEvent`s
  from `PipelineWatcher`, maps them to `PipelineSession` mutations, detects
  phase transitions, and pushes `pipeline-progress` events via `WebSocketEventBus`.

This matches the existing pattern: `DebateSession` (api) is a data holder;
`DebateChannelBackend` (runtime) owns the orchestration logic.

### PipelineSession domain model (server/api/)

**`PipelineSession`:**
- `pipelineId: String` — unique identifier (UUID)
- `debateSessionId: String` — links to existing debate session for WebSocket routing
- `dimensions: List<DimensionDescriptor>` — ordered list of dimension states
- `ordered: boolean` — parallel vs sequential execution
- `specPath: String` — the spec being reviewed
- `currentPhase: PipelinePhase` — tracks pipeline progression
- `checkpointStatus: CheckpointStatus` — NONE, PENDING, or RESOLVED
- `decisions: List<PipelineDecision>` — parsed decisions from decisions.md

All field mutations go through methods that are synchronized on the session
instance. Multiple `PipelineWatcher` threads call `PipelineOrchestrator` which
calls these methods — thread safety is required.

**`DimensionDescriptor`:**
- `name: String` — coherence, structure, robustness, crosscutting
- `workspacePath: String` — filesystem path to dimension's review workspace
- `status: DimensionStatus` — PENDING, RUNNING, DONE, KILLED, FAILED
- `currentRound: int`, `totalRounds: int`, `degree: String`
- `issuesByPriority: Map<String, Integer>` — HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW counts
- `cost: double`, `elapsedSeconds: int`
- `findings: List<PipelineFinding>`

**`PipelinePhase`** enum:
`ROUND_1`, `HIL_CHECKPOINT_1`, `REMAINING_ROUNDS`, `HIL_CHECKPOINT_2`,
`CROSS_CUTTING`, `COMPLETE`

When `ordered = true`, the phase model changes: only one dimension runs at a
time. The phase sequence becomes per-dimension rather than across-all. The
pipeline header renders as `Structure` → `HIL` → `Coherence` → `HIL` →
`Robustness` → `HIL` → `Cross-cutting` (matching the design-review skill's
ordered sequence). `PipelineOrchestrator` tracks which dimension is active
and advances to the next when the calling session calls `dimension_accepted`.

**`CheckpointStatus`** enum: `NONE`, `PENDING`, `RESOLVED`

**`DimensionStatus`** enum: `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `DONE`, `KILLED`, `FAILED`

`FAILED` covers `REVIEW FAILED`, `REVIEW CRASHED`, and `REVIEW INTERRUPTED`
terminal states from review.py. The browser shows a failed badge (distinct
from killed — killed is a deliberate human decision, failed is an error).

**`PipelineDecision`:**
- `id: String` (D1, D2, ...)
- `title: String`
- `choice: String`
- `alternatives: List<String>` — one-line each
- `rationale: String`
- `tradeoffs: String`
- `status: String` — captured, revised, confirmed, challenged, rejected
- `explorationDepth: String` — quick, deep-analysis, multi-agent-debate
- `dependsOn: String` — optional, references another decision ID

**`PipelineFinding`:**
- `dimension: String`
- `issueId: String`
- `priority: String` — HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- `summary: String`
- `status: String` — open, verified, deferred
- `location: String` — optional, document location for cross-panel routing

### PipelineDecisionParser

Utility class in `server/api/` that parses the `decisions.md` markdown format
into a `List<PipelineDecision>`. Splits on `## D<N>:` headers, extracts
`**Choice:**`, `**Alternatives:**`, `**Rationale:**`, `**Trade-offs:**`,
`**Exploration:**`, `**Status:**`, and optional `**Depends on:**` fields.

### PipelineWatcher (server/runtime/)

A lightweight progress.log tailer — NOT a reuse of `WorkspaceWatcher`.

The review surfaced that `WorkspaceWatcher` is tightly coupled to the debate
channel infrastructure: it requires a `DebateSession`, `MessageService`,
`WorkspaceReplayAdapter`, and full channel dispatch machinery (reviewer/
implementor file parsing, message dispatch, tracker diff reconciliation).
Pipeline dimensions only need progress.log tailing for status events.

`PipelineWatcher` extracts the progress.log tailing concern:
- Watches a single workspace directory for `progress.log` changes
  (reuses `DirectoryWatcher` from io.methvin)
- Tails new lines, parses via `ProgressLogParser.parse()`
- Delivers parsed `ProgressEvent`s to a `Consumer<ProgressEvent>` callback
  (the `PipelineOrchestrator`)
- Stops on terminal events (`ReviewTerminal`)

This is ~50 lines — the tail logic extracted from
`WorkspaceWatcher.tailProgressLog()` without the debate channel dispatch.

**Future:** `WorkspaceWatcher` can be refactored to compose `PipelineWatcher`
for its progress.log tailing, eliminating duplication. Not in scope for this
issue.

### PipelineOrchestrator (server/runtime/)

`@ApplicationScoped`. Owns the state machine logic that maps `ProgressEvent`s
to `PipelineSession` state changes and pushes WebSocket events.

**Event → state mapping:**

| Event | State change |
|-------|-------------|
| `DimensionStart` | dimension → RUNNING, update round/degree |
| `RoundFindings` | update issuesByPriority, populate findings |
| `RoundEnd` | increment currentRound, update addressed/contested counts |
| `DimensionDone` | dimension → DONE, update final cost/issues |
| `ReviewTerminal(DONE)` | dimension → DONE |
| `ReviewTerminal(FAILED/CRASHED/INTERRUPTED)` | dimension → FAILED |
| `RoundComplete` | update round number, check phase transitions |

**Findings population:** When a `RoundFindings` event arrives, the orchestrator
reads the dimension's `tracker.md` file (at `workspacePath/tracker.md`) to
extract individual finding entries (issue ID, priority, summary, location).
This is a one-time read per round — `WorkspaceParser.parseTracker()` already
handles this format. The parsed entries become `PipelineFinding` objects on the
`DimensionDescriptor`.

**Phase auto-advancement:**
- All non-cross-cutting dimensions have `currentRound >= 1` → advance to
  `HIL_CHECKPOINT_1`
- All surviving (non-KILLED, non-FAILED) dimensions reach DONE → advance to
  `HIL_CHECKPOINT_2`
- `crosscutting_started` MCP call → advance to `CROSS_CUTTING`
- `pipeline_complete` MCP call → advance to `COMPLETE`

**Checkpoint resolution:** When the calling session calls `update_pipeline`
with `dimension_accepted` for the last unresolved dimension, the orchestrator
sets `checkpointStatus = RESOLVED` and advances to the next phase
(`REMAINING_ROUNDS` after checkpoint 1, or presents the cross-cutting gate
after checkpoint 2).

**Thread safety:** `PipelineOrchestrator` synchronizes on the `PipelineSession`
instance when processing events. Multiple `PipelineWatcher` threads deliver
events concurrently — the orchestrator serializes mutations.

After each state change, the orchestrator pushes a full `pipeline-progress`
snapshot via `WebSocketEventBus.pushMetadata()`.

### PipelineSessionRegistry

`@ApplicationScoped` in `server/runtime/`. In-memory
`ConcurrentHashMap<String, PipelineSession>`. No persistence — pipelines are
transient (tied to a running review, not historical).

Methods: `create(PipelineSession)`, `get(String pipelineId)`,
`remove(String pipelineId)`.

**Cleanup:** `pipeline_complete` action in `update_pipeline` stops all
`PipelineWatcher` instances and removes the session from the registry. If the
calling session never calls `pipeline_complete` (abandoned review), sessions
remain in memory until server restart — acceptable for a development tool.

### PipelineMcpTools

New `@Tool` class in `server/runtime/` alongside `DebateMcpTools`.

**`start_pipeline`:**

```
@ToolArg description = "Debate session ID to link pipeline events to"
String debateSessionId

@ToolArg description = "Dimensions to review, as JSON array: [{name, workspacePath, degree}]"
String dimensions

@ToolArg description = "Sequential execution with cascading findings (true) or parallel (false)"
boolean ordered

@ToolArg description = "Path to the spec being reviewed"
String specPath
```

Creates a `PipelineSession`, starts a `PipelineWatcher` per dimension,
registers in `PipelineSessionRegistry`, pushes initial `pipeline-progress`
event. Returns pipeline state JSON.

**`update_pipeline`:**

```
@ToolArg description = "Pipeline ID"
String pipelineId

@ToolArg description = "Action: checkpoint_reached, dimension_refused, dimension_accepted, crosscutting_started, pipeline_complete"
String action

@ToolArg description = "Dimension name (required for dimension_refused, dimension_accepted)"
String dimension
```

For state changes that can't be derived from progress.log — specifically,
HIL decisions made in the terminal:

- `checkpoint_reached` — sets `checkpointStatus = PENDING`
- `dimension_refused` — sets the named dimension's status to `KILLED`,
  stops its `PipelineWatcher`
- `dimension_accepted` — confirms the dimension continues; if all dimensions
  are now accepted, sets `checkpointStatus = RESOLVED` and advances phase
- `crosscutting_started` — sets `currentPhase = CROSS_CUTTING`
- `pipeline_complete` — sets `currentPhase = COMPLETE`, stops all watchers,
  removes from registry

Each action is **idempotent** — calling the same action twice with the same
parameters is a no-op (returns current state). This handles retry scenarios
from the calling session.

Each action pushes an updated `pipeline-progress` event.

**`load_decisions`:**

```
@ToolArg description = "Pipeline ID"
String pipelineId

@ToolArg description = "Path to decisions.md file"
String decisionsPath
```

Reads the file, parses via `PipelineDecisionParser`, stores on the
`PipelineSession`, pushes a `pipeline-decisions` event. Can be called
multiple times as decisions are revised — each call replaces the
previous decision list.

### WebSocket event topics

Two new topics via the existing `WebSocketEventBus.pushMetadata()`:

**`pipeline-progress`** — full pipeline state snapshot:
```json
{
  "pipelineId": "...",
  "phase": "ROUND_1",
  "checkpointStatus": "NONE",
  "ordered": false,
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "name": "coherence",
      "status": "RUNNING",
      "currentRound": 2,
      "totalRounds": 3,
      "degree": "standard",
      "issuesByPriority": {"HIGH": 1, "MEDIUM": 2, "LOW": 0},
      "cost": 2.10,
      "elapsed": 145,
      "findingsCount": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

**`pipeline-decisions`** — decision list:
```json
{
  "pipelineId": "...",
  "decisions": [
    {
      "id": "D1",
      "title": "PipelineSession architecture",
      "choice": "Thin registry over existing WorkspaceWatchers",
      "alternatives": ["Heavy pipeline orchestrator", "Event aggregation middleware"],
      "rationale": "Preserves separation...",
      "tradeoffs": "Requires explicit MCP calls...",
      "status": "captured",
      "exploration": "quick"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both route through the debate session's channel ID.

### Browser reconnect recovery

When the browser reconnects (WebSocket reconnect event), the pipeline panel
needs to recover current state. The panel sends a `pipeline-state-request`
message on the WebSocket. The server responds with the current
`pipeline-progress` and `pipeline-decisions` snapshots from the
`PipelineSessionRegistry`. This reuses the existing reconnect pattern from
`debate-feed` (which replays debate entries on reconnect).

### workspace-status enhancement

The existing `workspace-status` panel gains a handler for `pipeline-progress`
events. When a pipeline is active, it shows a compact summary:
`Pipeline: 2/3 dimensions running` or `Pipeline: checkpoint pending`. This
replaces the per-dimension `workspace-progress` display when a pipeline is
active — the pipeline panel owns the detailed view.

## Browser-Side Changes

### New panel: `review-pipeline`

A LitElement panel in `@casehubio/blocks-ui-document-workbench`, following
existing patterns (Shadow DOM, `configure(props)`, `onPagesEvent()`,
`_cleanups[]` teardown).

**Event subscriptions:**
- `pipeline-progress` — updates phase header, dimension cards, findings
- `pipeline-decisions` — updates decision section
- `reconnected` — requests current state snapshot

**Layout (vertical stack):**

1. **Decisions section** — `<details>` element, collapsible.
   - Each decision: compact card with `D<N>: title` header + status badge
     (colour-coded: captured=grey, confirmed=green, challenged=amber,
     rejected=red, revised=blue)
   - Expanded: choice, alternatives (one-line each), rationale, trade-offs
   - Auto-collapses when all decisions reach terminal status

2. **Pipeline header** — horizontal row of phase segments:
   - Parallel mode: `Round 1` → `HIL` → `Rounds 2+` → `HIL` → `Cross-cutting`
   - Ordered mode: `Structure` → `HIL` → `Coherence` → `HIL` → `Robustness`
     → `HIL` → `Cross-cutting`
   - Active: accent colour, bold text
   - Complete: success colour, checkmark icon
   - Pending: muted colour
   - HIL segments: warning badge when `checkpointStatus === 'PENDING'`

3. **Dimension cards** — one per dimension, ordered:
   - Status badge: running (pulsing dot, reuse workspace-status animation),
     done (green check), killed (red, strikethrough label),
     failed (red, error icon — distinct from killed)
   - Progress bar: thin bar showing `currentRound / totalRounds`
   - Stats line: issue count pills (HIGH=red, MEDIUM=amber, LOW=grey),
     cost (`$X.XX`), elapsed timer (`Nm Ns`)
   - Killed dimensions: "refused at checkpoint" label
   - Failed dimensions: "review failed" or "review crashed" label

4. **Findings feed** — scrollable list:
   - Each finding: dimension colour badge, priority pill, issue ID, summary
   - Grouped by dimension, most recent first within group
   - Filter bar: priority toggle buttons (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / all)
   - Click → dispatch `point-selected` event with document location
     (reuses existing cross-panel wiring from review-tracker)

**Empty state:** When no pipeline is active, the panel shows
"No active review pipeline" with muted text.

### Workbench integration (index.ts)

- Register: `registerPanel("review-pipeline", "review-pipeline")`
- Layout: add `withId("pipeline", hostPanel("review-pipeline", {}))` to the
  right-side vertical split
- Topbar: add toggle button `<button id="btn-pipeline">⚙ Pipeline</button>`
- Visibility: default hidden (`pipelineVisible = false`). Auto-shown when a
  `pipeline-progress` event arrives (via `pages-event` listener in index.ts).
  Toggle button controls manual show/hide.
- Split ratios when pipeline visible: debate 35%, pipeline 30%, threads 15%,
  review 20%
- Split ratios when pipeline hidden: debate 45%, threads 25%, review 30%
  (unchanged)

## Testing

### Java unit tests

- **ProgressLogParser** — `DimensionStart`, `RoundFindings`, `RoundEnd`,
  `DimensionDone` parse from `EVENT: {...}` lines. Existing plain-text
  event types unchanged. Null/blank/malformed JSON returns null.
- **PipelineSession** — dimension status transitions
  (PENDING→RUNNING→DONE, PENDING→RUNNING→KILLED, PENDING→RUNNING→FAILED),
  phase progression, checkpoint status changes, synchronized access from
  multiple threads.
- **PipelineOrchestrator** — event-to-state mapping: DimensionStart sets
  RUNNING, DimensionDone sets DONE, ReviewTerminal(FAILED) sets FAILED.
  Phase auto-advancement triggers. Checkpoint resolution logic. Ordered
  mode advances one dimension at a time.
- **PipelineWatcher** — tails a test progress.log, delivers parsed events
  to a callback, stops on terminal event.
- **PipelineSessionRegistry** — create/get/remove, concurrent access.
- **PipelineDecisionParser** — parse decisions.md format, all fields
  including optional `Depends on:`, empty/malformed input.

### Integration tests

- **PipelineMcpTools** — `start_pipeline` creates session and returns
  state JSON, `update_pipeline` with each action pushes correct events,
  `update_pipeline` idempotency (same action twice is no-op),
  `load_decisions` parses and pushes decision data, unknown pipeline ID
  returns error.
- **PipelineWatcher integration** — watcher tails a progress.log containing
  `EVENT:` lines, new event types parsed and delivered to callback.

### E2E tests (Playwright)

- **Panel visibility** — hidden by default, topbar button toggles,
  auto-shown on pipeline-progress event.
- **Dimension cards** — mock pipeline-progress events via WebSocket,
  verify status badges (running/done/killed/failed), round progress,
  issue counts, cost.
- **Pipeline header** — active/complete/pending phase styling on
  state transitions. Ordered mode shows dimension names as phases.
- **Findings feed** — mock findings, verify rendering with dimension
  badges and priority pills. Click finding → `point-selected` dispatched.
- **Decision cards** — mock pipeline-decisions events, verify status
  badges. Auto-collapse when all confirmed.
- **HIL checkpoint** — mock checkpoint_reached, verify warning badge
  on HIL phase segment.
- **Reconnect recovery** — disconnect WebSocket, reconnect, verify
  pipeline state is recovered.

## Dependencies

- No new external dependencies
- Extends existing `ProgressLogParser` (new sealed records)
- New `PipelineWatcher` (extracts tail logic, reuses `DirectoryWatcher`)
- New panel in `@casehubio/blocks-ui-document-workbench` (existing package)
- review.py already emits required JSONL events (soredium#198 shipped)

## Non-goals

- Browser-based HIL control (approve/refuse/discuss stays in the terminal)
- Persistence of pipeline state (transient, in-memory only)
- Changes to review.py or the design-review skill's orchestration logic
- Cross-dimension context flow during reviews (dimensions stay isolated)
- New event types in review.py (existing events are sufficient)
- Refactoring WorkspaceWatcher to compose PipelineWatcher (follow-on)
